# Using Records from Airtable in Microsoft Power BI/Query

Airtable provides a developer platform which allows you to create, read, update and delete records in a given base.  Using the [Airtable REST API](https://airtable.com/api), weâ€™ve seen organizations create sophisticated data pipelines between Airtable and other services, such as [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/).
 
[This support article](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403440453015-Sending-Airtable-data-to-Microsoft-Power-BI-Power-Query) outlines a solution for Power Query / Power BI that allows you to pull in records from an Airtable table. The script referenced in the document is available in this Github repository.
