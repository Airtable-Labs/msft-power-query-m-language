# Using Records from Airtable in Microsoft Power BI/Query

Airtable provides a developer platform which allows you to create, read, update and delete records in a given base.  Using the [Airtable REST API](https://airtable.com/api), weâ€™ve seen organizations create sophisticated data pipelines between Airtable and other services, such as [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/).
 
[This document](https://airtable.docsend.com/view/tqn4hq7t9kgvri4d/d/qu7qjp9f6smi34np) outlines a solution for Power Query / Power BI that allows you to pull in records from an Airtable table. The script referenced in the document is available in this Github repository.
